#Prosper Loan Data Exploration

The Prosper loan dataset comprises of 113937 loan entries with 81 attributes on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others, from the year 2009-2014.
## SUMMARY OF FINDINGS
During the exploration, it was observed that the borrower APR is negatively correlated with original loan amount. At different size of the loan amount, the APR has a large range, but the APR decrease with the increase in the loan amount. The borrower APR also decreases with the increasingly better rating. Borrowers with the best Prosper ratings have the lowest APR. It means that the Prosper rating has a strong effect on borrower APR. 
More so, I also observed that the loan amount is positively correlated with the stated monthly income, which means borrowers with higher monthly income could loan more money. Employed, self-employed and full-time borrowers makes up 90% of the borrowers. 

## KEY INSIGHTS FOR PRESNTATION
During the presentation, I focus on how frequently different users assess Loan services and features that could affect the borrower APR and, which are original loan amount, Prosper rating. Then, I showed the relationship between APR vs. loan amount, as well as APR vs. rating. I also investigated the effect of rating on relationship between APR and loan amount, as well as the effect of rating on relationship between borrower APR and term.
Afterwards, i have used box plots,pairgrid, scatterplot,line plots to find the relationship between my area of interest.
